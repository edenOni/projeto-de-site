                    <p>about me-
                        Hello! normally in socials bios i can't talk a lot about me and share why and who is making the art. first off, my name is apple, you can call me however you want, i have 18 years and i am a trans artist that lives in a abusive household, i started my career with the goal to get away from here. i really do say a lot about the situation in my discord server, that is linked below, i created the most ways as possible for you to support me so you can donate any quantity in my kofi, you can donate 3$ in my patreon, and any quantity in my twitter or paypal. i am aways trying to come up with new things for my followers to feel invested and safe around me 游비
                        here in this page you will spot all my links together, if you want to commission me or donate through paypal, you can go into the "commissions! " tab 游비.
                        i am in this world of art since i was a little kid, but i only started working seriosly with it in january of this year, i speak more than one language, that are french, i -understand- spanish, speak english and also portuguese, so if you feel more comfortable with any of these languages you can talk to me with them 游비
                        supporters greetings:
                        thank you all so much for helping me in this journey, which is so harsh on me doesn't matter what i do, you guys are keeping me moving, so thank you so very much all of the helpers that decided to donate, commission or subscribing monthly 游비

                    <p>By the way, this is my twitter (x), if you click it, it will magically transport you into elon musky land. Where he hates me more than trans individuals and pratices his menacing activities against me (doesnt let me send infinite messages), and get his musky (foul) essent all over twitter and fakes being his own son, due to legal reasons, all you read here if compared to a real life situation is merely coincidental 游비.</p>
